// Development Plan: Commit the code each time a step is completed.
// [ ] Fill in the boilerplate Arduino code
// [ ] Print the line "I'm ready!" to the serial port when the device starts.
// [ ] Print the line "Still Ready..." every two seconds.
// [ ] Instead of "Still Ready", print the number of times that the loop() function has run.
// [ ] Print the amount of time the device has been running, as well as which loop it is on, seperated by a comma.
// [ ] Change the first text that is printed to be headers: "idx,time"
// [ ] Add another column to what is printer: the temperature sensor's current value.
// [ ] Convert the signal to degrees celsius with the equation 1 / (log(1 / (1023. / analogueInput - 1)) / 3950.0 + 1.0 / 298.15) - 273.15
// [ ] Calculate a running mean of the temperature over the last second, and add that as a column to the output.
// [ ] Attach a blue LED and a red LED to the Arduino in the simulation.
// [ ] Whenever the running mean is increasing, turn on the red LED.  Whenever it is decreasing, turn on the blue LED.
